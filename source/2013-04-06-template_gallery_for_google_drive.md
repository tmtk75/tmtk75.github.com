## Where is templates?
I've really wondered why google drive doesn't have template feature.
There were no any links to template list in the page, and
If I clicked the CREATE button, I couldn't find any icons for template.

## How to configure apps in Google Drive
But now I finally found out how to configure as we get the link  
I will explain it.

Click the gear icon on the top-right and chooose "Manage apps".
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-1-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-1-1-1.png'/></a>

Click the link "Connect more apps".
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-2-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-2-1-1.png' width='512px'/></a>

Input "template" in the search box and press the enter.
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-3-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-3-1-1.png' width='512px'/></a>

You can probably see a few apps related for Google Drive template.  
Click a "+ CONNECT" which you prefer.
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-1-2.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-1-2.png' width='512px'/></a>

Click "OK".
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-4-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-4-1-1.png' width='512px'/></a>

Click "OK" again.
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-5-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-5-1-1.png' width='512px'/></a>

## Succeeded to configure
Then, if you click "CREATE", you can see the app you selected.
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-6-1-1.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/My+Drive+-+Google+Drive-6-1-1.png'/></a>

And you will jump to the [Google Docs Template Gallery](https://drive.google.com/templates).
<a href='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/Google+Docs+Templates.png'><img src='https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/tmtk75.github.com/2013-04-06/Google+Docs+Templates.png' width='512px'/></a>

Actually, I'm wondering why google doesn't prepare this template feature by default.
