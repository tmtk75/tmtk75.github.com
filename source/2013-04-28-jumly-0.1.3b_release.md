Released JUMLY-0.1.3b.  
It's tested on jQuery-2.0.0.

At v0.1.3b, JUMLY finally supports a public API in order to evaluate DOM nodes.
Using this API, you can evaluate nodes whenever you like.
Until now JUMLY has evaluated at only `DOMContentLoaded` event.

If you call `JUMLY.scan`, it creates diagrams based on related nodes which are not evaluated yet. This is based on [#7 disscussion](https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly/pull/7).

Now there is a notation about this API [here](http://jumly.herokuapp.com/reference#_api). It's a bit messy because I wrote in hurry.
I'm writing down a new one in another page now.
