Wrote a [d3](http://d3js.org) plugin which gives your linecharts dashed rubberband to guide.

This actual demo is here, <http://tmtk75.github.io/d3.svg.rubberband/>.

Here is a screenshot.

It's based on an example of d3, <http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245>.


About the detail, see the README, <https://github.com/tmtk75/d3.svg.rubberband/blob/master/README.md>.
