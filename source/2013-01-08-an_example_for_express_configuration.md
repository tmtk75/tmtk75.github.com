[express](http://expressjs.com/) is a very useful web application framework for node.js.
I'm using it for my site for [JUMLY](http://jumly.herokuapp.com).

I frequently use it for making a small web app, but it's a bit hard to configure a new bootstrap script of express from scratch.

I made a gist for reuse of current JUMLY configuration of express with the package.js
