Hi, jQuery-2.0.0 was released. It's a good new for jQuery guys.

JUMLY, <http://jumly.herokuapp.com/>, is already tested on jQuery-2.0.0, too.

And also I bumped up each version of some libraries like node.js and coffee-script.
node 0.10.4 and coffee-script 1.6.2 are available now, which are the latest at now.
