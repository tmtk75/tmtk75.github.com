I'm happy to announce [JUMLY v0.1.0-beta](https://jumly.herokuapp.com/) which is a JavaScript library
that you can easily render sequence diagram on your HTML document
only loading a small JavaScript file and CSS file without special tools.

[Here is a simple example](http://jumly.herokuapp.com/examples/simple.html).

I think JUMLY is one of most lightweight UML tools.
Please check it out!
