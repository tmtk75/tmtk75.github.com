I love [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) as a MVVM framework of JavaScript.
[meteor](http://meteor.com) doesn't support knockout yet, but I found a good bridge, 
[knockout.meteor](https://github.com/steveluscher/knockout.meteor).
It's really good that I've not made same one.

Using it, I implemented a simple but enough todo app, [knockout.meteor-demo](http://knockout-meteor-demo.meteor.com).
Actually, this is not helpful because of single user :)

The number of line is totally less than 200 lines including \*.coffee, \*.html and \*.less.
That's surprisingly code-less.

knockout.meteor-demo is at [github.com](https://github.com/tmtk75/knockout.meteor-demo).
