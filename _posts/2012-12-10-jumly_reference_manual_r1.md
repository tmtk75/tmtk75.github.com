I released [Reference Manual r1](http://jumly.herokuapp.com/reference) for JUMLY sequence diagram directives.
I think you can somehow see JUMLY's feature.

JUMLY is a JavaScript library which I develop, which easily generates UML diagrams on client side with only HTML5 and CSS3.  
Enjoy, [JUMLY](http://jumly.herokuapp.com/)!
