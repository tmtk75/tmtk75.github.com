title: Chef server installation for ubuntu-12.04

ubuntu-12.04 was released. I tried setting up chef server on it.
It was almost same except for ruby's version.

I didn't see the package 'ruby1.9.2-full' in yum list, instead of it, found ruby1.9.1-full.

Anyway, chef server works well with ruby1.9.1-full =)
