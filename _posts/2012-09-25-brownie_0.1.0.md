  <strong>Sorry!</strong> brownie has already unpublished from npm. Let's use [GRUNT](http://gruntjs.com/).
</div>

I released a smart npm module, [brownie-0.1.0](https://github.com/tmtk75/brownie).
brownie provides three features.

- generate coffee-script project which is publishable to npmjs.org at once.
- you can develop your new project right away because Cakefile is already configured for popular tasks like compile, minify and test(run spec).
- help making task of Cakefile and support namespace for tasks.

install brownie with npm.

```bash
$ npm -g install brownie
...
$ brownie init myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm install
...
$ node bin/cli.js you
hello, you
```

set PATH using .setenv which brownie generated, type cake and you'll see a few tasks.

```bash
$ . .setenv
$ cake
Cakefile defines the following tasks:

cake compile              # compile *.coffee
cake minify               # minify myapp.js
cake spec::run            # run spec with jasmine-node
cake spec::compile        # compile *Spec.coffee
```

compile task compiles \*.coffee under lib/js directory.

```bash
$ cake compile
Compiled lib/js/myapp.coffee to build/.js/myapp.js successfully

$ ls build
myapp.js
```

minify task minimize build/myapp.js.

```bash
$ cake minify
$ ls build
myapp.js  myapp.min.js
```

spec::run task runs all specs under spec directory.

```bash
$ cake spec::run
.

Finished in 0.015 seconds
1 test, 1 assertion, 0 failures
```

spec::compile task compiles spec/\*.coffee as compile task.

```bash
$ cake spec::compile
Compiled spec/myappSpec.coffee to build/.spec/myappSpec.js successfully

$ ls build
myapp.js  myapp.min.js  myappSpec.js
```
