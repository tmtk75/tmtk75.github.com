I knew colon command from a bash script which one of my colleagues wrote.
He uses it because of usage as here document like

    :<<doc
    usage: foobar <arg1> [arg2]
    Change arg1 as args, if arg2 is empty...
    option:
    ...
    doc


The colon is a command to do nothing and return exit code zero.
That's OK. I understand.

I don't know why it is used here.
I'll ask him today.
