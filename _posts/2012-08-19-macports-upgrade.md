title: MacPorts and Command Line Tools for Xcode

What I want to say in this post is "Don't forget installation of Command Line Tools if you use MacPorts".


I ran into the following error when I update meteor to the latest.

    $ git fetch gh
    dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libexpat.1.dylib
      Referenced from: /opt/local/libexec/git-core/git-remote-https
      Reason: Incompatible library version: git-remote-https requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libexpat.1.dylib provides version 7.0.0

I thought I updated git with [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) and did selfupdate of MacPorts.

    $ sudo port selfupdate
    --->  Updating MacPorts base sources using rsync
    MacPorts base version 2.1.1 installed,
    MacPorts base version 2.1.2 downloaded.
    --->  Updating the ports tree
    --->  MacPorts base is outdated, installing new version 2.1.2
    Installing new MacPorts release in /opt/local as root:admin; permissions 0755; Tcl-Package in /Library/Tcl
    
    Error: /opt/local/bin/port: port selfupdate failed: Error installing new MacPorts base: command execution failed

Then I faced another error.

It seemed I had to install with [MacPorts-2.1.2-10.8-MountainLion.pkg](https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.1.2-10.8-MountainLion.pkg) because my OS version is 10.8 a.k.a Mountain Lion.

So I installed it and ran MacPorts again.

    tsakuma@~/workspace/meteor$ sudo port upgrade outdated
    Warning: The Command Line Tools for Xcode don't appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build.
    Warning: See http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.xcode.html for more information.
    --->  Configuring apr
    Error: org.macports.configure for port apr returned: configure failure: command execution failed
    Please see the log file for port apr for details:

    Error: Unable to upgrade port: 1

Oh, oops, not yet. What do I needâ€¦? Ah, yes, [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) is maybe. That guess was right. It's released for Mountain Lion.

After installation, I tried upgrade for just expat.

Yep, looks working well.

Mh...? Why does port install subversion...? I've not already used it...

BTW, that's OK I was able to fetch the latest of meteor =)
